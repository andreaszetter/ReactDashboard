## **Andreas Changes**

I added functionality to the overview page with Information about spending, a budget planner and a savings tracker. 
The information part of the overview page has some charts that visually represent your spendings in categories. It also has
a graph of how much has been spent per month. There is also a tab where you can allocate how much you want to budget for each
of the categories and how much of your total salary will be saved. 
I also changed the way that adding spendings works. Before you had to type the categories in each time, which was redundant
since we already had a page for adding categories. I just changed the input to be a choice between existing categories so that
it is easier for the user to document their spendings without having to type it each time.
Other than that I have made some small tweaks to the UI, for example an indication of which of the pages in the sidebar you 
are currently on, since before there was no such indicator which could be confusing for some users.
